    "1.   We are using **Amazon Alexa Reviews dataset (3150 reviews)**, that contains: **customer reviews, rating out of 5**, date of review, Alexa variant \n",
    "2.   First we  **generate sentiment labels: positive/negative**, by marking *positive for reviews with rating >3 and negative for remaining*\n",
    "3. Then, we **clean dataset through Ventorization Feature Engineering** (TF-IDF) - a popular technique\n",
    "4. Post that, we use **Support Vector Classifier for Model Fitting** and check for model performance (*we are getting >90% accuracy*)\n",
    "5. Last, we use our model to do **predictions on real Amazon reviews** using: a simple way and then a fancy way\n",
